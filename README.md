Over the years between 2015 and 2020. Each county had its own relative pattern in trends of Violent Crimes. Violent crimes focuses primarilay on murder cases, sexaul assault and battery to name a few. Each county had its own trend as either going in a positive direction, a negative direction, or sporadic. In each and every county there was a disproportionate amount of crimes reported and crimes cleared. However, the pattern in which crimes were both reported and cleared, typically stayed the same throughout the progression of time.

With the population of each of the county relative to the amount of violent crime taking place, we can see that Denver certainly has a relatively high population, while maintaining a positive trend of crime cleared in relation to reports
